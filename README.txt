code repository: https://github.com/albutko/ml_reinforcement_learning

This code was written using python 3. To run any of the functions first install python3

I have provided a `requirements.txt` file with necessary dependencies. install these using
conda or pip

pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install --file requirements.txt

All experiments were done in a Jupyter Notebook called `Reinforcement Learning.ipynb`
To open this use the following command

jupyter notebook Reinforcement\ Learning.ipynb

Then to recreate any experiments you can either run the entire notebook or run the necessary
cells. Make sure that you set the problem environment if you want to run a specific test. These cells
include a comment # RUN TO DEFINE PROBLEM.

The jupyter notebook is divided similar to the report and can be navigated using the headers
